# Homework

## Description
I decided to use Typescript to do the homework.

I created different :

- agregatedData.ts : An agregatedData class to represent the data in the json files
- node.ts : A Node Class to agregate the data on a generic tree
- asciitree.js : Credit goes to Anton Medvedev, I borrowed his class to help visualise the node tree with an ascii representation

## Note
I modified the json inside the datasource to be like the example in the readme

## Run the homework
Run the following to run the homework
```
npm i
npm start
```

or

```
npm i
ts-node  .\homework.ts path/to/datasource
```
